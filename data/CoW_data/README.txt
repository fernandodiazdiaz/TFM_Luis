In this folder, there are two equivalent files: allies_and_enemies_1816_2014_iso and allies_and_enemies_1816_2014_COW. The only difference between files is the country codes used, which are the international ISO-3 codes and the Correlates of War codes, respe3ctively. 
 The ISO-3 codes are the ones used for most of the computation, including any code that generates maps. 
 The COW codes are used for all computations regarding the comparison with the ground truth matrix of historical events.
 The file countries_codes_and_coordinates.csv contains the ISO-3 codes and the countries that they represent.
